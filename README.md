# Overview
WIP level editor for Project Eden, a video game released originally in 2001 by the British studio Core Design.
The program is written in high-quality C++.

# Rendering Technology
The program uses a modern and powerful Direct3D 12 renderer. Video RAM and GPU heaps are managed manually for maximum performance.
On top of that, I implemented _bindless textures_, which is a powerful feature which allows for faster and more flexible texture streaming.

# The User Interface
The program sports a lightweight UI, which was programmed using the native Windows API (Win32).

# Screens
This example shows the program's user interface as well as a temple level loaded in. The user can add and remove objects, as well as alter their various attributes on the panel on the right.
